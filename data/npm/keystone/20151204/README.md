## Overview
Invalid email addresses can be mistakenly matched during sign-in. This affects the `User` record to be fetched from the DB. Correct password for that `User` is still required to authenticate.

## Recommendations
Upgrade to version 0.3.16 or greater. 

If a direct dependency update is not possible, use [`snyk wizard`](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk#wizard) to patch this vulnerability.

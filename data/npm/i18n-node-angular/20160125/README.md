## Overview
A REST API `/i18n/:locale/:phrase` endpoint was accessible in production environment, allowing to add previously unknown translation literals to the translation files. This feature can be abused to mount a XSS attack via content injection, or a Denial of Service attack by exhausting storage resources on the server.

## Remediation
Upgrade `i18n-node-angular` to version 1.4.0 or greater.

If a direct dependency update is not possible, use [`snyk wizard`](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk#wizard) to patch this vulnerability.

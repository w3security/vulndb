## Overview
When CORS is enabled on a hapi route handler, it is possible to set a crumb token for a different domain. An attacker would need to have an application consumer visit a site they control, request a route supporting CORS, and then retrieve the token. With this token, they could possibly make requests to non CORS routes as this user.

A configuration and scenario where this would occur is unlikely, as most configurations will set CORS globally (where crumb is not used), or not at all.

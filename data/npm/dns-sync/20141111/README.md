## Overview

The dns-sync library for node.js allows resolving hostnames in a synchronous fashion. All versions of dns-sync prior to the release 0.1.1 were vulnerable to arbitrary command execution via maliciously formed hostnames.

_Source: [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/6)_

## Details

For example:

    var dnsSync = require('dns-sync');
    console.log(dnsSync.resolve('$(id > /tmp/foo)'));

This is caused by the hostname being passed through a shell as part of a command execution.

## Remediation

Upgrade dns-sync to version 0.1.1 or greater.

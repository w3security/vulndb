## Overview
[secure-compare](https://www.npmjs.com/package/secure-compare) is a node implementation of constant-time comparison algorithm to prevent timing attacks for Node.js. In versions prior to 3.0.1, the `compare` function made sure that the length of the two arguments is the same, and then mistakenly compared the first argument to itself, meaning that the function would return true for any two arguments of the same length.

## Remediation
Upgrade to version 3.0.1 or greater. 

When direct dependency update is not possible, use [`snyk wizard`](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk#wizard) to patch against this vulnerability.

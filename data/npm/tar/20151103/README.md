## Overview
The [`tar`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar) module prior to version 2.0.0 does not properly normalize symbolic links pointing to targets outside the extraction root. As a result, packages may hold symbolic links to parent and sibling directories and overwrite those files when the package is extracted.

## Remediation
Upgrade to version 2.0.0 or greater. 
If a direct dependency update is not possible, use [`snyk wizard`](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk#wizard) to patch this vulnerability.
